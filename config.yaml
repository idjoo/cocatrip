  I am a student at Bina Nusantara University, majoring in Cyber Security. Love
  using linux and been using it since 2019. Altough i major in Cyber Security i
  don’t like doing Cyber Security stuff, it’s just a way for me to learn linux
  and other stuff related to Infrastructure and Deployment. Rather than doing
  Cyber Security stuff i’d prefer doing what i like the most and that is playing
  with kubernetes, working on my homelab, deploying an application, and other
  kind of stuff similar to that.
